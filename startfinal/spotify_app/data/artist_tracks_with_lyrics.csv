A tale as old as time I wake up screaming from dreaming One day, I'll watch as you're leaving And life will lose all its meaning For the last time [Chorus] It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me I'm the problem, it's me At teatime, everybody agrees I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero [Bridge] I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money She thinks I left them in the will The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out ""She's laughing up at us from Hell"" [Breakdown] It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi Everybody agrees, everybody agrees [Chorus] It's me, hi Hi I'm the problem, it's me I'm the problem, it's me At teatime Teatime, everybody agrees Everybody agrees I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"
