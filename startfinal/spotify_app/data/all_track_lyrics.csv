A tale as old as time I wake up screaming from dreaming One day, I'll watch as you're leaving And life will lose all its meaning For the last time [Chorus] It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me I'm the problem, it's me At teatime, everybody agrees I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero [Bridge] I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money She thinks I left them in the will The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out ""She's laughing up at us from Hell"" [Breakdown] It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi I'm the problem, it's me It's me, hi Everybody agrees, everybody agrees [Chorus] It's me, hi Hi I'm the problem, it's me I'm the problem, it's me At teatime Teatime, everybody agrees Everybody agrees I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes When life comin' at you from all angles and sides And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside It really boils down to how you plan to survive Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em? Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom And they recognize the bathroom All hell starts to break loose in my texts I only tell lies to who I gotta protect I would rather have you remember me how we met I would rather lose my leg than lose they respect But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step That ain't what I'm 'bout I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?

I'll let you bring a thousand recruits My peers are a talented group But even if you take all they statistics and carry the two Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops There's still nothin' they could really do It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due Whenever it's time to recoup Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?"" I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die What you got, time on your hands or time on your side? Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high? Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai? Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties And all of these fortunate times And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size? Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find? Like healin' my soul, like family time Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive? Is there more? [Outro: Nai Palm] Passion, instant Sweat beads, feel me Feel me Cupid's shot me My heartbeat's racing My heartbeat's racing Tempt me, drive me Tempt me It feels so exciting Thought of highly Highly It's yours entirely I'll be, I'll be more than a lover More than a woman More than a lover for you"

So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time . So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my, my genius, my energy. Enjoy"

When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes Well, you took me to hell too And all at once, the ink bleeds A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme But I've felt a hole like this Never before and ever since [Chorus] If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary What we thought was for all time was momentary Still alive, killing time at the cemetery Never quite buried You cinephile in black and white All those plot twists and dynamite Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry You said I'm the love of your life [Bridge] You shit-talked me under the table Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles I wish I could un-recall How we almost had it all Dancing phantoms on the terrace Are they second-hand embarrassed That I can't get out of bed 'Cause something counterfeit's dead? It was legendary It was momentary It was unnecessary Should've let it stay buried [Chorus] Oh, what a valiant roar What a bland goodbye The coward claimed he was a lion I'm combing through the braids of lies ""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind"" Our field of dreams engulfed in fire Your arson's match, your somber eyes And I'll still see it until I die You're the loss of my life"
