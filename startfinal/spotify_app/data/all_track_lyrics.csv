Mutual,Shawn Mendes,the simple guitar and drumladen thematic of mutual is underscored by its simple message if you dont love back leaving may be the only option i want you close to me i want you close i want you closer but when youre here with me its hard to tell just what youre after you say you want all of me today but tomorrows not the same my feelings never change what do you want from me what do you want uh i need to know if this is mutual before i go and get way too involved i want you bad can you reciprocate no i dont want to have to leave but half of yous not enough for me this inconsistency what does it mean you got me questioning the way you act and take it back do i mean anything just tell me honestly you say you want all of me today but tomorrows not the same my feelings never change what do you want from me what do you want uh i need to know if this is mutual before i go and get way too involved i want you bad can you reciprocate no i dont want to have to leave but half of yous not enough for me are you playin me is this a game when you show up late say love at 2 am then tell me you cant stay girl yeah what do you want from me baby oh i need to know if this is mutual before i go and get way too involved i want you bad baby can you reciprocate no i dont want to have to leave but half of yous not enough for me
